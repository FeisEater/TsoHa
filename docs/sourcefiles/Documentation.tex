\section{Introduction}
This web application is a forum of questions and answers, akin to \emph{stackoverflow} and \emph{yahoo answers}. The web service will let a user find solutions to problems either by browsing the web site or asking a question oneself. Questions can be answered by other users and each answer can be rated. Highest rated solution offers are shown at the top. With enough questions and answers in the database, the service can provide a quick and convenient way to look up a solution for a problem of any kind. Tags can be added to the asked question to help browsing questions by category.\\
\indent Service will be hosted on university's users-server via Tomcat. Code will be written in Java via NetBeans IDE. App will use PostgreSQL database. User's browser will not require other scripts or plug-ins.

\section{Installation}
To install the application, copy \emph{QuesAns.war} file to \emph{tomcat/webapps/} folder. Copying the file should be enough to make the tomcat unpack the file within the \emph{.war} file. \newline Next, configure \emph{context.xml} file at \emph{tomcat/webapps/QuesAns/META-INF/} to connect to the Postgres database. Use \emph{context.xml.dist} for reference. \newline
Now, as long as tomcat is running, web application should now be working.

\section{How to run and use the app}
Web application is accessed at the url: \emph{servername.com/QuesAns/}. At the moment of writing it is accessed at \emph{http://t-pasmpasm.users.cs.helsinki.fi/QuesAns/}. Press sign up at top-right corner to get started by registering a user. Notice that reading other questions and even asking a question doesn't require the user to be registered.
