The web service will let a user find solutions to problems either by browsing the web site or asking a question oneself. Questions can be answered by other users and each answer can be rated. Highest rated solution offers are shown at the top. With enough questions and answers in the database, the service can provide a quick and convenient way to look up a solution for a problem of any kind. Tags can be added to the asked question to help browsing questions by category.\\
\indent Service will be hosted on university's users-server via Tomcat. Code will be written in Java via NetBeans IDE. App will use PostgreSQL database. User's browser will not require other scripts or plug-ins.
